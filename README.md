Training image recognition model 

Steps:
1- I opened Teachable Machine website then I choose image project,I defined 2 classes (sun,moon). 
2- In sun class I uploaded several images of sun from my computer, I did the same thing with the moon class.
3- I clicked on train model.
4- I upladed  image of moon from my computer to test model and the result showed that it was indeed a moon 100%.
5- I uploaded an image of sun to make sure that the model was able to differentiate between sun and moon and give 
correct result.
